# AviMove

Python package for the analysis of avian movement and behaviour. Currently involves two sub-modules, `cal_wind2` and `forage_detect`, implementing the methodologies of [Goto et al., 2018](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.1700097) and [Garrod et al., 2021](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.1700097).
